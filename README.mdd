# Smart Irrigation System – GCP (Firebase) Prototype

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Google Cloud Platform's Firebase Realtime Database** to collect and monitor environmental data for smart irrigation.  
The system uses NodeMCU ESP8266, a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, and a soil moisture sensor. Data is sent to Firebase and can be accessed in real-time via a dashboard.

## Hardware Components
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- DHT11 Sensor (Temperature & Humidity)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- Power Supply

## Features
- Reads temperature (°C), humidity (%), and soil moisture level.
- Sends data to Firebase Realtime Database on GCP every 5 seconds.
- Wi-Fi connection handled automatically at startup.
- Modular code with functions for connectivity and data upload.

## GCP Services Used
- **Firebase Realtime Database** – Stores sensor data for live access.
- (Optional) **Firebase Hosting** – Can host a simple HTML dashboard.
